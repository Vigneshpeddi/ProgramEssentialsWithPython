#Week 2 Day 1:  Lab #1A

#This program follows the flowchart from Lab #1A

#Step 1 of Flowchart: START
#"Start" represents your starting comments

#Step 2 of Flowchart: PROCESS -> cost = 25.40
cost = 25.40   #I have assigned 25.40 to the variable cost

#Step 3 of Flowchart: PROCESS -> margin = 20
margin = 20  #I have assigned 20 to the variable margin

#Step 4 of Flowchart: PROCESS -> sellingprice = (1/(1-margin/100)) * cost
sellingprice = (1/(1-margin/100)) * cost
 #sellingprice = (1/(1-margin/100)) * 25.40
 #sellingprice = (1/(1-20/100)) * 25.40
 #sellingprice = (1/(-19/100)) * 25.40



 #Step 5 of Flowchart: OUTPUT -> sellingprice
print(sellingprice)
